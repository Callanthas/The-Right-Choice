The Right Choice 

A website made for the Coding Bootcamp 2nd Project, our team's goal was to make a page from scratch that worked as a functional site for a company dedicated to renting women's dresses.

Visit https://immense-tundra-95450.herokuapp.com/ to see the page.
Made using: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Handlebars, Sequelize, MySQL, JQuery, Node, Bootstrap, among others.
